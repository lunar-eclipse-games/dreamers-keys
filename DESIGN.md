# Core Concept

Dreamer's Keys is an Exile-like ARPG that offers players exciting loot to find, various satisfying means of progression, engaging systems to interact with and learn, and complete control over how time is spent.

Most aspects of the game are completely optional, and a player may choose to interact with them as much or as little as they like.

# Main Features

## Core Game Loop

The core loop consists of using the titular "Dreamer's Keys" to open doors to unique, procedurally generated worlds called "Keyscapes" that contain loot, enemies, puzzles, materials, story quests, and other kinds of content to explore.

After finishing exploring the Keyscape, the player returns home to manage their loot, upgrade equipment, trade with other players before venturing on to the next world.

## Player Freedom

Most systems in the game are entirely optional and players can decide if and how much they want to interact with them. This includes, for example, combat. A player can choose to enter dreamscapes without any enemies appearing. This is useful if a player would either like to temporarily focus on collecting materials, or complete an entirely pacifist playthrough.

## Player-Guided Development

Dreamer's Keys is developed in a 100% transparent and open way. Every roadmap, design document, and decision is publicly accessible. Even the game's source code is stored in an open repository.

Contributions by players are greatly appreciated in the form of issue reports, pull requests, feature requests, or art submissions.

While the game itself is entirely free-to-play, a small group of "Core Developers" is sustained through donations and a purely cosmetic micro transaction shop.
